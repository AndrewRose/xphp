xphp is a thread safe (ZTS) command line (CLI) build of PHP for Archlinux including some of the more advanced extensions to allow developing desktop apps using wxwidgets, network clients/servers using libevent, threaded applications using pthreads or even some crazy wih runkit etc

Be sure to build and install xphp first as phpize is required for building the pecl extensions.
